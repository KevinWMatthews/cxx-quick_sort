Implement swap between i and j.
Implement recursion
    Does partitioning work with an odd number of elements?
    At what step is recursion required?

Figure out how to make a header-only library.
    If quick sort uses a template, it may well be just this.

Check what iter_swap() does if we point to the same element!

Will the template implementation of
    using iter_type = typename T::iterator;
work with vectors?
Perhaps we can use auto in functions.
